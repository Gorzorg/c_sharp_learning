This repository contains the result of my first impact with the C# language.
It contains some combinatorics iterators (e.g. listing permutations),
a binary heap API, and their respective tests.

I tried implementing everything while keeping efficiency in mind,
and trying to learn C# idioms and concepts. While this is most likely far
from perfect, I am at the moment satisfied with the resulting code.

### A note on tests

The test methods are very thorough, and on some machines they may take
a while to run. In case they don't return immediately, give them
a couple of minutes to run.
